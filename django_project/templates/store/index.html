                <p class="paragraph">A compound of telephone and lexigram,
                <em class="telexi_text"> telexi </em>
                is a communication platform which seeks to improve
                mutual understanding between humans and dogs. </p>


                <h4 class="question_headers">What is it ...exactly?</h4>
                <p class="paragraph">Physically, <em class="telexi_text">telexi </em>
                 is a series of manufactured tiles with embedded touch sensors
                and a speaker.</p>

                <p class="paragraph">The sensors enable <em class="telexi_text">telexi </em>
                to receive and process touch events from dogs. </p>

                <p class="paragraph">When a dog touches a
                tile with its nose or paw, <em class="telexi_text">telexi </em> interprets this
                    touch as an <em>intent</em> and vocalizes the intent with an associated
                audio clip.</p>

                <h4 class="question_headers">How does it work?</h4>

                <p class="paragraph">Consider a dog who’s conditioned to
                associate the word “water” with the real thing. When
                its trainer speaks “water”, the dog receives water. </p>

                <div class="container">

                <hr class="hr"/>

                <p class="paragraph">Now let's equip the trainer with a
                <em> telexi</em> device and smartphone app.</p>

                <p class="paragraph">First he plugs the device into a power outlet. Then,
                he opens his phone's wifi settings and selects the <em>telexi</em> network,
                which establishes an internet connection with his local wifi router.</p>

                <div class="container">
                    <img id="water-audio-clip-passes-to-telexi-hub-illustration"

                    />
                </div>


                <p class="paragraph">Now the trainer opens the <em class="telexi_text">telexi </em> app,
                where he's prompted for a recording.
                He speaks "water" and submits the audio clip.</p>

                <hr class="hr" />

                <p class="paragraph">Our trainer is now ready to attach a tile to the device
                to serve as a visual representation of "water".</p>

                <p class="paragraph">In order to distinguish between words, we must use unique
                    shapes called <em>lexigrams</em>. Because the shape of his dog's water dish is a circle,
                he chooses that shape and connects the tile to the device.
                 </p>

                    device as dog watches
                </p>
                <br/>

                <p class="paragraph">Navigating back to the app, he
                 assigns the "water" audio clip to the tile. </p>

                 <p class="paragraph"><em class="telexi_text">telexi </em>
                     uploads the clip into his device's vocabulary,
                     which can now speak "water" from its position
                     on the wall, floor, or surface.
                 </p>
                <br/>

                <p class="paragraph">
                    Now, when the dog touches the
                    tile, it can request water!
                    The dog telephoned a lexigram!

                <hr class="hr"/>

                <h4 class="question_headers">Ok, so the dog can “talk” but isn’t this a novelty? </h4>

                <p class="paragraph">
                    True -- touching a tile to speak
                    a word isn’t exactly
                    remarkable. Products like these exist already.

                    <em class="telexi_text"> telexi</em>'s
                    development was inspired by the
                    research of John W. Pilley, whose
                    work with Chaser the Border Collie
                     demonstrates that dogs can comprehend sentences with a
                    prepositional object, verb, and direct object. </p>

                    <p class="paragraph">Pilley recounts their
                    triumphs and shortcomings in

                    We believe dogs are capable of complex and
                    abstract thought. <em>telexi</em>, as a work in progress,
                    aims to be the best tool available which
                    enables dogs to <em>express</em> these thoughts.
