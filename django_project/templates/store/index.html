      <h4 class="question_headers">What is telexi?</h4>
                <p class="paragraph">A compound of telephone and lexigram,
                <em class="telexi_text"> telexi </em>
                is a communication platform which seeks to improve
                mutual understanding between humans and dogs. </p>


          <hr class="hr"/>
            <h4 class="question_headers">What is it ...exactly?</h4>
                <p class="paragraph">Physically, <em class="telexi_text">telexi </em>
                 is a series of manufactured tiles with embedded touch sensors
                and a speaker.</p>

                <p class="paragraph">The sensors enable <em class="telexi_text">telexi </em>
                to receive and process touch events from dogs. </p>

                <p class="paragraph">When a dog touches a
                tile with its nose or paw, <em class="telexi_text">telexi </em> interprets this
                touch as an intent and vocalizes the intent with an associated
                audio clip.</p>


            <hr class="hr"/>
            <h4 class="question_headers">How does it work?</h4>

                <p class="paragraph">Consider a dog who’s conditioned to
                associate the word “water” with the real thing. When
                its trainer speaks “water”, the dog receives water. </p>

                <div>
                    <img class=""
                    src="{% static 'img/serve.png' %}"

                         height="500px"
                    />
                </div>

                <p class="paragraph">Now let's equip the trainer with
                <em> telexi</em>'s device and app.</p>

                <div>
                    <img class=""
                    src="{% static 'img/loop.png' %}"
                    alt="diagram of flow"
                         height="500px"
                    />
                </div>

                <p class="paragraph">The trainer plugs in the device,
                opens his phone's wifi settings, and selects the <em>telexi</em> network,
                which establishes an internet connection with the wifi router.</p>

                <p class="paragraph">The trainer then opens the <em class="telexi_text">telexi </em> app,
                where he's prompted for a recording.
                He speaks "water" and submits the audio clip.</p>




            <hr class="hr"/>

<p class="paragraph">Our trainer is now ready to attach a tile. The tile
                will serve as a visual representation of "water".</p>

                <p class="paragraph">In order to distinguish between words, we must use unique
                shapes called lexigrams. Because the shape of his dog's water dish is a circle,
                he chooses that shape and connects the tile to the device.
                 </p>

                <p class="insert">Image here where man connects a tile to the device while dog watches on</p>


                <p class="paragraph">Navigating back to the app, he
                 assigns the "water" audio clip to the tile. </p>

                 <p class="paragraph"><em class="telexi_text">telexi </em> uploads
                 the clip into his device's vocabulary,
                which can now speak "water" from its position on the wall, floor, or surface.</p>

                <p  class="insert">insert image of dog touching tile with its nose as man watches on with a smile</p>

                <p class="paragraph">Now, when the dog touches the
                tile, it can request water! The dog telephoned a lexigram!</p>



                <hr class="hr"/>

                <h4 class="question_headers">
                Ok, so the dog can “talk” but isn’t this a novelty? </h4>

                <p class="paragraph">True -- touching a tile to speak a word isn’t exactly
                remarkable. Products like these exist already. </p>

                <p class="paragraph">What separates <em class="telexi_text">telexi </em>
                from traditional training buttons is the integration of software.</p>


                <p class="paragraph"><em class="telexi_text">telexi</em>'s app tracks
                touch events over time to visualize patterns
                    which emerge in data.</p>

                </div>

                    <p>The data is profiled and
                 sourced as a reference point for dogs of the same
                breed, sex, age, or other criteria.</p>

                <p class="paragraph">
                <em class="telexi_text"> telexi</em>'s development was inspired by the
                research of John W. Pilley, whose
                work with Chaser the Border Collie
                 demonstrates that dogs can comprehend sentences with a
                prepositional object, verb, and direct object. For example,
                    "take snoopy To boston" from Trial 2a.

                </p>


                <p class="paragraph">We believe dogs are capable of
                 abstract and complex thought. </p>

    <p>We aim to develop a tool which enables dogs to
                    begin expressing these thoughts. In doing so, we will provide researchers with
                    data to help improve humanity's understanding of dog cognition,
                    sourced from touch events by our own best
                friends around the world.</p>
